    "### **Q1: Why might you choose a deque from the** collections **module to implement a queue instead of using a regular Python list?**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **deque (double-ended queue)** from the collections module is\n",
    "preferred over a regular Python list for queue implementation because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Efficient Append and Pop Operations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   deque.append() and deque.popleft() have **O(1) time\n",
    "        complexity**, whereas list.pop(0) has **O(n) time complexity**\n",
    "        due to shifting elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Optimized for Queue Operations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Deques allow **fast insertion and deletion** from both ends,\n",
    "        making them more suitable for **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)\n",
    "        queues**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Memory Efficiency:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Deques are implemented as **doubly linked lists**, reducing\n",
    "        overhead compared to resizing operations in lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "CopyEdit\n",
    "\n",
    "from collections import deque\n",
    "\n",
    "queue = deque()\n",
    "\n",
    "queue.append(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "queue.append(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "queue.append(3)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(queue.popleft()) \\# Output: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q2: Can you explain a real-world scenario where using a stack would be a more practical choice than a list for data storage and retrieval?**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out)** is useful in scenarios where the\n",
    "most recently added data should be accessed first.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Real-World Example: Web Browser Back Button**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   When a user visits web pages, they are stored in a **stack**.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Pressing the **Back** button pops the last visited page, taking the\n",
    "    user to the previous page.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "CopyEdit\n",
    "\n",
    "stack = \\[\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# User visits pages\n",
    "\n",
    "stack.append(\"Homepage\")\n",
    "\n",
    "stack.append(\"About Us\")\n",
    "\n",
    "stack.append(\"Contact Us\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# User presses back button\n",
    "\n",
    "print(stack.pop()) \\# Output: \"Contact Us\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(stack.pop()) \\# Output: \"About Us\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q3: What is the primary advantage of using sets in Python, and in what type of problem-solving scenarios are they most useful?**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **primary advantage** of using sets in Python is that they allow\n",
    "**fast membership testing and duplicate removal** due to their\n",
    "**hash-based implementation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Use Cases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Removing Duplicates from a List:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Since sets only store **unique values**, they are ideal for\n",
    "        removing duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Checking Membership Efficiently:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   x in set has **O(1) time complexity**, whereas x in list has\n",
    "        **O(n) time complexity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Set Operations (Union, Intersection, Difference):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Used in **database queries, recommendation systems, and text\n",
    "        processing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "CopyEdit\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = \\[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "unique_numbers = set(numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(unique_numbers) \\# Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q4: When might you choose to use an array instead of a list for storing numerical data in Python? What benefits do arrays offer in this context?**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays are preferred over lists when dealing with **large numerical\n",
    "datasets** because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Memory Efficiency:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Arrays store elements of the **same data type**, consuming less\n",
    "        memory than lists, which store references.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Faster Computations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Operations on arrays are **faster** because they use\n",
    "        **contiguous memory allocation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Suitable for Mathematical Operations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Libraries like **NumPy** provide optimized array operations,\n",
    "        making them ideal for **scientific computing and machine\n",
    "        learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example Using NumPy Array:**\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "CopyEdit\n",
    "\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "arr = np.array(\\[1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\])\n",
    "\n",
    "print(arr \\* 2) \\# Output: \\[ 2 4 6 8 10 \\] (Element-wise\n",
    "multiplication)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q5: In Python, what's the primary difference between dictionaries and lists, and how does this difference impact their use cases in programming?**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **primary difference** is how they store and access data:\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Feature**           | **Dictionary (dict)**                             | **List (list)**                |\n",
